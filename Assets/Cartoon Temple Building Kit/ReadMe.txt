Lightmaps are generated on import. No colliders are placed or generated.

On the models when lightmaps are baked you might see some dark leak on the edges.
You can ease this by enlarging the objects scale on the lightmap.
On the example scenes the lighting method is mostly set to baked (except scene 8 and 10).
So all the gameobjects are set to static and lights are set to bake.

Prefabs are set to all static.

One material and atlas texture for all models 2048*2048 png.
The emission texture is only white for the Arrow, Cross, Light Orb and Sun Symbol models.
If you are using the emission texture you can change the white square to desired color inside
any texturing program like photoshop.
More emission models might come in future if updated. Depending on download rates.
